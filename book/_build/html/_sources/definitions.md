Scattering signature
  Difference in brightness temperature between two different frequency channels for snow-covered ground due to volume scattering.

Signal saturation
  Scattering signature cannot be used to estimate snow depths for snow depths above about 1.25 m because maximum volume scattering has been reached.

Snow water equivalent
  Snow water equivalent or SWE describes the equivalent amount of liquid water contained within a snowpack, and is defined as the product between snow depth and snow density. It is measured as a water column that would result if the whole snowpack was melted instantaneously.

Terrestrial snow area
  The terrestrial snow area or TSA describes the extent of snow-covered land.
