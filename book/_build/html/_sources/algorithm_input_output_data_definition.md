# Algorithm Input and Output Data Definition (IODD)


## Input data

Daily Level-2 brightness temperature data are the main input, including the 19 GHz channel of horizontal polarisation and of the 37 GHz channel of both polarisations.

```{note}
If available, early morning satellite data is preferred as input over late afternoon data in order to minimise effects of liquid water within the snowpack.

## Ancillary data

Ancillary data include a static water mask in order to have a consist definition of land and water grid cells. Furthermore, latitudes that fall outside the area of interest are masked out in order to avoid false positive snow cells. For the Northern Hemisphere all latitudes at and below 40° N are masked out, and for the Southern Hemisphere latitudes at and below x° S are affected.
