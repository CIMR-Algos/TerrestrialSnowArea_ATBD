## Functional description of each Algorithm step

Step 1: Mapping of L1B brightness temperatures to swath projection.

Step 2: Application of dry snow detection approach to gridded brightness temperatures.

Step 3: Output of L2 TSA maps.

Step 4: Optional masking e.g. land/water or latitude masking.

### Mathematical description

The dry snow detection algorithm of the TSA product is based on the approach of {cite:t}`hall_2002` but applies updated empirically derived thresholds as implemented for the EUMETSAT H SAF snow status product H11 {cite:p}`pulliainen_2010`. The brightness temperature difference between the Ku and Ka-band is used to estimate snow depth (SD) as

$$
\text{SD} = R_c \cdot (T_B^{18H}-T_B^{37H}),
$$ (TB_diff)

with regression coefficient $R_c$ of 1.59 cm/K and brightness temperatures $T_B$, where the superscripts show the frequency and polarisation.
For the algorithm in {eq}`TB_diff` to detect dry snow, the following thresholds must be met:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{SD} &â‰¥ 3.0~\text{cm}\\
T_B^{37V} &< 255~\text{K}\\
T_B^{37H} &< 250~\text{K}.
\end{aligned}
$$

The use of further CIMR channels for dry snow detection is under investigation.
