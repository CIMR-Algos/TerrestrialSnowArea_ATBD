Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer
  The Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer or CIMR mission by ESA includes a wide-swath conically-scanning multi-frequency microwave radiometer with launch planned for 2028.

Dry snow
  Snowpack with liquid water content equal to zero

Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid
  Northern and Southern Hemisphere projections of EASE-Grid 2.0 are based on polar aspect Lambert azimuthal equal-area projections, as defined by {cite:t}`brodzik_2012`.

Scattering signature
  Difference in brightness temperature between two different frequency channels for snow-covered ground due to volume scattering.

Signal saturation
  Scattering signature cannot be used to estimate snow depths for snow depths above about 1.25 m because maximum volume scattering has been reached.

Snow water equivalent
  Snow water equivalent or SWE describes the equivalent amount of liquid water contained within a snowpack, and is defined as the product between snow depth and snow density. It is measured as a water column that would result if the whole snowpack was melted instantaneously.

Terrestrial snow area
  The terrestrial snow area or TSA describes the extent of snow-covered land.
